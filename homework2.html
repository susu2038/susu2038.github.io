<h2>Mid-Autumn Festival-Origin</h2>
<p p style="color:Lavender;">
The Mid Autumn Festival is the legacy of the ancient celestial phenomenon worship - the custom of respecting the moon. In traditional culture, like the sun and the moon, these two alternate celestial bodies became the object of worship of our ancestors. In the 24 solar terms "autumnal equinox" season, it is the ancient "Moon Festival", and the Mid Autumn Festival comes from the traditional "autumnal equinox Moon Festival". According to textual research, the "Moon Festival" was originally set on the 24 solar terms "autumnal equinox" of the Ganzhi calendar. However, due to historical development, the calendar was later integrated and the lunar calendar (summer calendar) was used, so the "Moon Festival" was adjusted from the 24 solar terms "autumnal equinox" of the Ganzhi calendar to August 15 of the summer calendar. The Mid Autumn Festival is a synthesis of autumn seasonal customs. Most of the festival customs factors contained in it have ancient origins.

Moon cakes, also known as moon group, harvest cake, palace cake and reunion cake, are offerings to worship the moon god in the ancient Mid Autumn Festival. Moon cakes were originally used as offerings to the moon god. Later, people gradually took the Mid Autumn Festival to enjoy the moon and taste moon cakes as a symbol of family reunion. Moon cakes symbolize reunion. People regard them as festival food and use them to sacrifice the moon and give them to relatives and friends. Since its development, eating moon cakes has been a necessary custom for the Mid Autumn Festival in North and South China. On the Mid Autumn Festival, people have to eat moon cakes to show "Reunion".
